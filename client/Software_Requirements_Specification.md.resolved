## 2. GENERAL DESCRIPTION

### 2.1 PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE
The "Weather Project" is a new, self-contained product. It is a web application that follows the **Client-Server Architecture**.
*   **Frontend Interface**: Developed using React.js, running in the client's web browser. It is responsible for presentation and user interaction.
*   **Backend Server**: Developed using Node.js and Express.js. It acts as the middleware, handling business logic, authentication, and external API requests.
*   **Database**: MongoDB is used for persistent storage of user profiles and application state.
*   **Communication**: The system relies on RESTful API calls for standard data and WebSockets for real-time features.

### 2.2 PRODUCT FUNCTIONS
The major functions of the system include:
1.  **Secure Authentication**: Allowing users to register, login, and manage their sessions securely.
2.  **Location-Based Services**: Automatically detecting or manually searching for cities to retrieve weather data.
3.  **Weather Monitoring**: Displaying current temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and UV index.
4.  **Forecasting**: Providing a detailed look-ahead for the next 7 days.
5.  **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualizing historical and forecast data trends using interactive charts.
6.  **AI Assistant**: A real-time chat interface capable of understanding and answering weather-related questions.

### 2.3 USER CHARACTERISTICS
*   **Casual User**: Use frequency is high (daily). primary goal is to quickly check if it will rain or be sunny. Technical expertise is low.
*   **Power User/Analyst**: May be interested in specific metrics like pressure trends or humidity over time. Technical expertise is moderate.
*   **Administrator (Dev)**: Manages the system backend and API keys.

### 2.4 GENERAL CONSTRAINTS
*   **Connectivity**: The system requires an active internet connection to fetch data from Open-Meteo.
*   **Browser Support**: Must support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript enabled.
*   **Hardware**: The client device must have sufficient RAM (min 4GB recommended) to render React animations smoothly.
*   **Regulatory**: Must comply with data privacy laws regarding user passwords and location data.

### 2.5 ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES
*   **Assumption**: The Open-Meteo API will maintain its current free-tier availability and response format.
*   **Assumption**: The user has enabled location services if they wish to use the "My Location" feature.
*   **Dependency**: The system depends on the `npm` ecosystem for library management.
